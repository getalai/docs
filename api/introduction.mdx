## Base URL

```
https://slides-api.getalai.com/api/v1
```

---

## Authentication

Include your API key as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

---

## Async Workflow

All generation operations are **asynchronous**. Here's the typical flow:

```
1. POST /generations          → Returns { generation_id }
2. GET /generations/{id}      → Poll until status is "completed" or "failed"
3. Access results             → URLs available in the response
```

**Status values:**
- `pending` - Queued, not yet started
- `in_progress` - Currently processing
- `completed` - Finished; results available
- `failed` - Error occurred; check `error` field

**Recommended polling:** Every 2-5 seconds. Most generations complete within 30-120 seconds.
